<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This is a Linux version of TechUSB Creator, an application designed to create a bootable version of RepairTech's TechUSB. This project was developed by Aaron Atamian, a computer engineering student at California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, and an intern at RepairTech. We decided to open-source it in order to encourage future development and improvements.</p>
<h3>What is TechUSB?</h3>
<p>
TechUSB is a bootable computer repair utility that automates your hardware diagnostic and virus removal process in a bootable environment. It is designed specifically for IT Professionals. More info about TechUSB and TechSuite can be found on RepairTech's website.</p>
<br/><br/>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p> This application requires root. After launch, you will be required to enter your authentication key and the email address associated with it. Just like its Windows counterpart, this application allows you to put custom ISOs onto TechUSB that can be selected upon bootup. Additionally, the utility provides the option to format the USB drive that TechUSB will be copied to (This is not required, but it is recommended.). To begin the process of creating TechUSB, simply click "Download & Install." This will download the required files (roughly 830MB) and put them onto the selected drive. You will be notified when the process is finished.</p>
